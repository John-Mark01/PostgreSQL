# Data Agrregation
- combining multiple elements with a common property
- its done in SQL by ```GROUPING```



## Grouping - ```GROUP BY``` 
- allows taking data into ```separate groups``` based on a common property
- grouping will take all records from a column that we group with, and will return only the ```DISTINCT```(non repeating) records.

**From departments: Development, Support, HR, Development, HR, HR, if we group our query by departments, it will return -> (Development, Support, HR)**
