- the table is the main ```building block``` of any database
- each row is called a ```record``` or ```entity```
- ccolumns ```fields``` define the ```type``` or data they will contain

# Data Management
## Why do we need a Database
- data is everywhere - Id Card, Adress, WebSite, Notebook... etc.
- we need to store data somewhere. Where do we store our data? --> On a HardDrive!
  * However ```Data Managment``` is not the same as ```Storing Data```.
    - Storing data, is a storage for data
    - Data Management is how we organize, get, delete and MANAGE our data. This is called a _Database_.
   
1. We need to store and manage data
- we need a Database because we need to store data, then manage data, and quickly itterate over it and find what we need.


# PostgreSQL
- it is a ```ORDMBS``` -> Object-Relational Database Management System
- can create custom types
- it is a relational database(table-like)
- it is widely used ```open-source``` ```cross-platform``` system
  ### What makes PostgreSQL stand out?
  * it is the first to implement ```multi-version concurrency control feature```.
    It can make a lot of requests at the same time, without lagging.
  * Designed to be extesible
  * ```Can define custom data types, plugins, functions, etc..```
  * Active community
