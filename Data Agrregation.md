- allows taking data into ```separate groups``` based on a common property
- grouping will take all records from a column that we group with, and will return only the ```DISTINCT```(non repeating) records.
- all records that are repeating, they will be combined, and will be returned as one record.
- we always group by all columns we SELECT in our Query. If you SELECT first_name, last_name, we need to ```GROUP BY``` those two columns.

**From departments: Development, Support, HR, Development, HR, HR, if we group our query by departments, it will return -> (Development, Support, HR)**
